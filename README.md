# QS World Unviersities Rankings 2025: SQL AnalysisðŸŽ 

## OverviewðŸ“Š
This project uses data from Kaggle that provides a comprehensive overview of the QS World University Rankings for 2025, covering data from over 1,500 universities from 105 education systems around the world. The dataset includes institutional characteristics, regional classifications, and a range of performance indicators reflecting academic reputation, employability, sustainability, and internationalization. You can access it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/melissamonfared/qs-world-university-rankings-2025).

I used the dataset to practice SQL queries. I leveraged the sqlite3 library from Python to help analyze and generate insights from the data. I hope that it can help create better explanations of the data.
